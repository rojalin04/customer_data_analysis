# customer_data_analysis
1. Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Analytics workflow, starting from data loading in Python to building an interactive Power BI dashboard and presenting insights through a structured report and presentation.

The objective of this project is to:

Understand the dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Clean and preprocess the data

Perform analytical queries using SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server)

Build a Power BI dashboard for visualization

Generate a final analytical report

Present findings using a structured PPT (created with Gamma)

This project showcases skills in Python, SQL, data cleaning, visualization, and business reporting.

2. Dataset

The dataset contains structured data related to business/customer/transaction analysis.

It includes features such as categorical variables, numerical variables, and transactional records.

The dataset was loaded and processed using Python.

3. Tools & Technologies Used
